# Scroll Tabs for Visual Studio

[![Build](https://github.com/madskristensen/ScrollTabs/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/madskristensen/ScrollTabs/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

Download this extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace][marketplace]
or get the [CI build][vsixgallery].

--------------------------------------

> This extension was created as a response to the Visual Studio feature request
[Scrollable open file tabs with mouse wheel](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Scrollable-open-file-tabs-with-mouse-whe/353560).

When the mouse hovers over the document tabs and the mouse wheel is scrolled, the multi-line tabs feature is
being toggled on and off as shown in this animation.

![Multiline toggle](art/multiline.gif)

When the multi-line tabs feature is enabled and you navigate to a different document within a 
few seconds, the multi-line tabs will automatically collapse back to single-line.

This behavior gives you quick access to all your open documents by using the mouse wheel.

You can also move between open documents by holding the **Alt** key while scrolling the mouse wheel
anywhere in the IDE. Scrolling down will activate the document to the right of the currently 
open document and vice versa.

## How can I help?
If you enjoy using the extension, please give it a ★★★★★ rating on the [Visual Studio Marketplace][marketplace].

Should you encounter bugs or if you have feature requests, head on over to the [GitHub repo][repo] to open an issue if one doesn't already exist.

Pull requests are also very welcome, since I can't always get around to fixing all bugs myself. This is a personal passion project, so my time is limited.

Another way to help out is to [sponsor me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/madskristensen).
